	 * Sometimes, PVs change types, EGUs etc.

	 * We can rename the PV to a new but related name - this keeps the existing data as is.
	 * Or, we can attempt to convert to the new type, EGU etc.
	 * This method can be used to convert the existing data using the supplied conversion function.
	 * Conversions should be all or nothing; that is, first convert all the streams into temporary chunks and then do a bulk rename once all the conversions have succeeded.
	 * Note that we'll also be using the same conversion mechanism for imports and other functions that change data.
	 * So, when/if implementing the conversion function, make sure we respect the typical expectations within the archiver - monotonically increasing timestamps and so on.

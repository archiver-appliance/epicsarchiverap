     * Generic method to iterate over the data for specified PV.
     * We provide a time to start the iteration at ( inclusive ) and a direction and a Predicate.
     * The plugin then iterates ( forwards or backwards ) and calls the Predicate for each sample.
     * The iteration stops when the Predicate returns false or when we run out of samples.
     * Iteration also stops when we get an exception.
     * So this mode of traversal is vulnerable to corruption in the data.
     * We may relax this constraint later by providing a optional bool to ignore exceptions.
     * @param context  &emsp;
     * @param pvName The PV name
     * @param startAtTime Start the iteration at this time.
     * If going forwards, this is the first sample on or before the specified time.
     * If going backwards, this is the first sample on or after the specified time.
     * @param thePredicate - the Predicate to apply
     * @param direction - Forwards or backwards
     * @param searchPeriod - An estimate on the amount of time we want to iterate.
     * This is used to determine the appropriate chunks containing data at a very high level and thus to limit the search.
     * The predicate itself is the one that controls when the iteration terminates.
     * So, for example, you could specify a searchPeriod of 1 year but stop the iteration after 1 minute
     * @throws IOException  &emsp;

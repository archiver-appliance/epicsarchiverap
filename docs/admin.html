        <h3>Scripting</h3>
        For bulk operations, most administrators will almost find the scripting
        interface useful as well. All actions in the UI (in addition to a few
        that are not exposed in the UI) are accessible from within scripts -
        please see the <a href="details.html#scripting">details</a> page for
        more info. Click
        <a href="api/mgmt_scriptables.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a list
        of business logic accesible thru scripting. There are also many
        scripting samples in the
        <code><i>tomcat_mgmt</i>/webapps/mgmt/ui/help/samples/</code>
        folder.

      <section>
        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        Here are some aspects of the EPICS archiver appliance that should be
        monitored
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="term">Logs</span> - Monitor the logs periodically for
            Exceptions, OutOfMemory and FATAL error messages. You can use a
            variation of these commands
            <pre>
<code>
find /arch/tomcats -wholename '*/logs/*' -exec grep -l xception {} \;
find /arch/tomcats -wholename '*/logs/*' -exec grep -l FATAL {} \;
find /arch/tomcats -wholename '*/logs/*' -exec grep -l OutOfMemoryError {} \;
</code>
</pre>
            While exceptions in the retrieval and mgmt components could
            potentially be from user errors, any exceptions/FATAL messages in
            the ETL/Engine components should immediately be investigated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="term">Disk free space</span> - Monitor the disk free
            space in each of your stores (raising alarms if disk usage increases
            about a certain limit).
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="term">Connected PVs</span> - You can use the
            <code>getApplianceMetrics</code> BPL (see
            <code>samples/checkConnectedPVs.py</code>) to monitor the number of
            currently disconnected PVs. You can then send an email notification
            to the system administrators if this is greater than a certain
            percentage or absolute number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="term">Type changes</span> - You can use the
            <code>/getPVsByDroppedEventsTypeChange</code> BPL (see
            <code>samples/checkTypeChangedPVs.py</code>) to watch for any PV's
            that have changed type. If a PV changes type, the EPICS archiver
            appliance will suspend archiving this PV until the situation is
            manually resolved.
            <ol>
              <li>
                You can rename the PV to a new name.
                <ol>
                  <li>Pause the PV under the current name.</li>
                  <li>
                    Rename the PV to a new name using the
                    <code>/renamePV</code> BPL or the UI
                  </li>
                  <li>Delete the PV under the current name.</li>
                  <li>Re-archive under the current name.</li>
                </ol>
                This should now archive the PV using the new type; however,
                requests for the older data (which is of the older type) will
                have to made using the older name.
              </li>
              <li>
                The EPICS archiver appliance has some support for converting
                data from one type to the other. This is not available in all
                cases but you should be able to convert most scalars.
                <ol>
                  <li>Pause the PV</li>
                  <li>
                    If needed, consolidate and make a backup of the data for
                    this PV.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Convert to the new type using the
                    <code>/changeTypeForPV</code> BPL
                  </li>
                  <li>Resume the PV (if the conversion process succeeds)</li>
                </ol>
                The <code>/changeTypeForPV</code> alters the data that has
                already been archived; so you may want to make a backup first.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="term">Maintaining a clean system</span> - Monitoring
            connected PVs (see above) is made significantly easier if you
            maintain a clean system. One strategy that can be used is to pause
            PV's that have been disconnected for more than a certain time. The
            <code>/getCurrentlyDisconnectedPVs</code> returns a list of
            currently disconnected PVs and some notion of when the connection to
            this PV was lost.
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can (perhaps automatically) pause PVs that have been
                disconnected for more than a certain period of time.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can (perhaps automatically) resume PVs that have been paused
                (obtained using the <code>/getPausedPVsReport</code>) but are
                now alive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optionally, you can potentially delete PVs that have been paused
                for some time and are still not alive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <section>
        <h3>Backing up your config databases</h3>
        Each appliance has a config database; typically a MySQL database. This
        config database contains the archiving configuration; that is, how each
        PV is being archived and where the data is stored. So, it's good policy
        to back this database up periodically. For example, one can do a daily
        backup using <code>mysqldump</code>; this should be more than adequate.
        <pre>
<code>
mysqldump -u <i>userid</i> -p <i>password</i>  archappl &gt; <i>/path/to/backupfile</i> 
</code>
</pre>

        It is also good practice to validate the backups every so often. Most
        labs have some scripts that perform some basic validation of these
        backups. Please ask if you need more info.
      </section>

      <section>
        Note that because the config database contains only configuration, the
        database itself should see very little traffic. In fact, if you are not
        adding any PV's or altering the configuration in any way, you should not
        have any traffic on the database at all. Each appliance assumes that it
        has complete ownership of its config database; so it makes sense to have
        the database as part of the appliance itself. However, it is good
        practice to store the backup file elsewhere; perhaps in a location that
        is redundant and is itself backed to tape.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Recovering from a lost appliance</h3>
        <div>
          In case you lose an appliance, you can use the backup of the config
          database to restore the appliance configuration onto a new machine.
          Simply go thru the install procedure and create an appliance with the
          same identity as the machine that was lost. This should yield an
          appliance with an empty config database; you can import the
          configuration into this empty database using
          <pre>
<code>
mysql -u <i>userid</i> -p <i>password</i>  archappl &lt; <i>/path/to/backupfile</i> 
</code>
</pre>
          Restarting the appliance after this should pick up the imported
          configuration. As the JVM can cache DNS lookups, giving your
          replacement appliance the same IP address as the one that was lost
          should also help if you have a cluster of machines.

        <h3>Inspecting the Channel Access ( also PVAccess ) protocol</h3>
        <div>
          To troubleshoot certain issues in production, it is often more
          practical to inspect the wire protocol. For example, to see if the
          archivers are issuing search requests to the IOC when looking into
          connectivity issues, it's faster to get a packet capture from
          production and then inspect the same elsewhere. Michael Davidsaver
          maintains a
          <a href="https://github.com/mdavidsaver/cashark/"
            >Wireshark LUA plugin</a
          >
          that can understand Channel Access ( and PVAccess ). Here's an example
          of this process
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, take a packet capture using Wireshark or tcpdump. For
              example, you can constrain tcpdump to capture packets on the
              network interface <code>em1</code> between the archiver appliance
              and the IOC using something like so
              <code
                >/usr/sbin/tcpdump -i em1 'host ioc_or_gateway_hostname and
                appliance_hostname' -w /localdisk/captured_packets</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              The file <code>/localdisk/captured_packets</code> contains the
              packet capture and can be copied over to a dev box and inspected
              at leisure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wireshark has a very comprehensive GUI and can be used to load the
              packet capture. Alternatively, one can also use the command line
              variant of Wireshark called <code>tshark</code> like so
              <code
                >tshark -X lua_script:ca.lua -r captured_packets 2>&amp;1 |
                less</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Recent version of the EPICS archiver appliance display the Channel
              Access <code>CID - Client ID</code>,
              <code>SID - Server ID</code> and <code>Subscription ID</code> in
              the PV details page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pausing and resuming the PV during packet capture will also enable
              the <code>cashark</code> plugin to track the life cycle of the
              Channel Access channel.
            </li>

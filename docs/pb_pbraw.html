<h3>The <code>.pb</code> file format</h3>
<div>
The <a href="api/edu/stanford/slac/archiverappliance/PlainPB/PlainPBStoragePlugin.html">PlainPBStoragePlugin</a> in the EPICS archiver appliance uses Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">ProtocolBuffers</a> as the serialization mechanism. 
The PB definitions mapping EPICS DBR types to PB messages can be found in <a href="EPICSEvent.proto"><code>EPICSEvent.proto</code></a>.
PB files contain serialized PB messages; one per sample; a sample per line. 
The first line in a PB file is a header (<code>PayloadInfo</code> PB message) that contains some basic information like the PV name, its DBR type and so on.

As serialized PB messages are binary data; after serialization, newline characters are escaped to maintain a "sample per line" constraint.
<ol>
<li>The ASCII escape character <code>0x1B</code> is escaped to the following two characters <code>0x1B 0x01</code></li>
<li>The ASCII newline character <code>\n</code> or <code>0x0A</code> is escaped to the following two characters <code>0x1B 0x02</code></li>
<li>The ASCII carriage return character <code>0x0D</code> is escaped to the following two characters <code>0x1B 0x03</code></li>
</ol>
Because of the sample per line constraint, one can use <code>wc -l </code> to determine the number of events in a PB file.
The "sample per line" constraint also lets us determine where a sample begins and ends at any arbitrary location in the file.
</div>
<div>
PB files try to optimize on storage consumption. 
On an average, an <code>EPICS DBR_DOUBLE/PB ScalarDouble</code> consumes about 21 bytes per sample.
To save space, the record processing timestamps in the samples are split into three parts
<ol>
<li><b>year</b> - This is stored once in the PB file in the header.</li>
<li><b>secondsintoyear</b> - This is stored with each sample.</li>
<li><b>nano</b> - This is stored with each sample.</li>
</ol>
This leads to the side-effect that each PB file "belongs" to a year.
In addition, the record processing timestamps are guaranteed to be and expected to be monotonically increasing. 
The "monotonically increasing timestamps" constraint lets us use various search algorithms on PB files without the need for an index.
The <a href="api/edu/stanford/slac/archiverappliance/PlainPB/PlainPBStoragePlugin.html">PlainPBStoragePlugin</a> handles the translation back and forth between DBR types and raw PB messages and also enforces a strict partitioning.
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 1.0em">
The installation bundle also includes some utilities that manipulate PB files. 
These can be found in the <code>install/pbutils</code> folder of the <code>mgmt</code> webapp.
These include 
<ol>
<li><b>printTimes.sh</b> - This utility prints the record processing timestamps of all the samples in the set of specified PB files.</li>
<li><b>pb2json.sh</b> - This utility prints all the data in all the samples in the set of specified PB files as JSON that can potentially be loaded into Python or other languages.</li>
<li><b>validate.sh</b> - This utility performs some simple validation of the set of specified PB files or PB files in the specified folders.</li>
<li><b>repair.sh</b> - This utility performs some simple validation of the set of specified PB files or PB files in the specified folders.
If errors are found in a PB file, the PB file is repaired by copying the valid samples into a new file and then renaming it to the old file name.
It also support an option to make a backup of the original file before attepmting to fix it.

</ol>

<h3>The PB/HTTP protocol</h3>
The <code>PB/HTTP</code> is a binary protocol over HTTP that is an extension of the <code>.pb</code> file format.
The main difference is that PB files contain only one chunk (header+samples) while the PB/HTTP can contain many chunks. 
Chunks are separated by empty lines (<code>\n</code> characters) similar to how HTTP separates its headers from the body.
While streaming data over the PB/HTTP protocol, the server also uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding">HTTP chunks</a> to transfer the data across.
There is no strict formula on how many chunks there will per data retrieval request; the server chunks data based on data source/partition/other parameters.
The client library for the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/epicsarchiverap/pbrawclient/"><code>PB/HTTP</code></a> protocol handles the multiple chunks in a seamless fashion and presents the data to the caller as a single event stream.

        It is unlikely that the features of the archiver appliance match your
        requirements exactly over a period of time. Here are some of the
        existing ways that you can customize the archiver appliance (without
        forking from the existing source tree).

        <h3>Site specific builds</h3>
        The archiver appliance offers you the ability to customize the WAR files
        generated by the build in these ways.

          >. This is an excellent starting off point for folks who wish to build
          their own deployment bundles. This is tested against CentOS; but
          should be easily extensible for other distributions.

            The <code>src/sitespecific</code> folder contains materials specific
            to your site. You can use the environment variable
            <code>ARCHAPPL_SITEID</code> to control which set of sitespecific
            files are included in the generated WARS.
            <ol>
              <li>
                When you set this environment variable, you should see a message

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    You can generate WAR with <code>policies.py</code> specific

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Or you can unpack the WAR files within the container and

            The archiver appliance uses
            <a href="http://gradle.org">gradle</a> for its builds, and
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> for site specific
            build steps. As part of the gradle build process, you have the
            opportunity to call an ant script that is as part of the
            <code>src/sitespecific</code> folder. The <code>build.xml</code> in
            the <code>src/sitespecific</code> is called (if it exists) after the
            compile and staging tasks and before the WAR is packed. This lets
            you replace default collateral (like images, phone numbers in
            messages etc) with your own collateral in the generated WAR file(s).

      <section id="Policies">
        <h3>Policies</h3>
        <p>
          As outlined in the <a href="details.html">details</a> page, the
          archiver appliance support a wide variety of configurations. Not only
          that, we also support configuration on a per PV basis. We avoid
          exposing all of this complexity to the end user (the one who is
          requesting PVs to be archived) by using policies to provide
          intelligent defaults. Policies are contained in a python/jython script
          called <code>policies.py</code> that is typically located in the
          <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> of the <code>mgmt</code> webapp or by
          using the environment variable <code>ARCHAPPL_POLICIES</code>.
        </p>

        <div>
          At a very high level, when users request PVs to be archived, the mgmt
          &amp; engine webapps sample the PV to determine event rate, storage
          rate and other parameters. In addition, various fields of the PV like
          <code>.NAME</code>, <code>.ADEL</code>, <code>.MDEL</code>,
          <code>.RTYP</code> etc are also determined. All of these parameters
          are passed to the <code>policies.py</code> python script as a
          dictionary argument to a method in <code>policies.py</code> called
          <code>determinePolicy</code>; see the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/mgmt/policy/ExecutePolicy.html"
            >javadoc</a
          >
          for more details. This method is expected to use all of this
          information to make decisions on various archiving parameters
          including storage locations, storage technologies used etc and return
          these decisions as another dictionary. For example, the resulting
          dictionary contains a field called <code>dataStores</code> which is an
          array of
          <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/StoragePlugin.html"
            >StoragePlugin</a
          >
          URL's that can be parsed by the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/StoragePluginURLParser.html"
            >StoragePluginURLParser</a
          >. This is converted into a sequence of StoragePlugin's that is used
          like so
          <ol>
            <li>
              The engine webapp writes data into the first StoragePlugin in the
              sequence, i.e. <code>dataStores[0]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The ETL webapp schedules data transfers from one StoragePlugin to
              the next in the sequence according to their
              <a
                href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/common/PartitionGranularity.html"
                >PartitionGranularity</a
              >'s
            </li>
            <li>
              When servicing a data retrieval request, the retrieval webapp
              retrieves data from all of the datastores and then combines them
              using a merge/dedup operator.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
          Optionally, as part of a policy, we can also archive fields in
          addition to the VAL field. That is, one can establish a blanket policy
          that says something like
          <i
            >For all <code>ai's</code>, in addition to the
            <code>.VAL</code> field, also archive the
            <code>.HIHI, .LOLO</code> etc</i
          >
          These fields are stored as part of the data for .VAL field.
        </p>

        For more details and an example of a policy file, please look at the
        <code>src/sitespecific/tests/policies.py</code> that is shipped as part
        of the <code>tests</code> site. In addition to the
        <code>determinePolicy</code> method, there are a few more methods that
        need to be defined. These include
        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>getPolicyList</code> -- This returns a list of available
            policy names.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>getFieldsArchivedAsPartOfStream</code> -- This returns a list
            of fields that are to be archived as part of the stream.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="archappl_properties">
        <h3>Site specific properties</h3>
        There is a site specific properties file called
        <code>archappl.properties</code> that is typically present in
        <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> of all the webapps or as the environment
        variable <code>ARCHAPPL_PROPERTIES_FILENAME</code>. This contains
        various configuration elements that are common to all machines in the
        cluster and probably common to all deployments of the archiver appliance
        in your infrastructure. One of the advantages of having your site
        specific properties checked into the source repository is that as the
        system evolves and we add new configuration elements, default values for
        these new configuration elements can be added to
        <code>archappl.properties</code> of all the sites. The configuration
        elements present here are configuration decisions that are made during
        the initial scoping of your archiving project; so, please do look at
        these configuration elements and make choices appropriate to your
        installation.
      </section>

      <section id="key_mapping">
        <h3>Key Mapping</h3>
        The archiver appliance stores data in chunks that have a well defined
        key. The key is based on
        <ol>
          <li>The PV Name</li>
          <li>The time partition of the chunk</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For example, using the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ConvertPVNameToKey.html"
            >default</a
          >
          key mapping strategy, data for the PV
          <code>EIOC:LI30:MP01:HEARTBEAT</code> for the timeframe
          <code>2012-08-24T16:xx:xx.xxxZ</code> on an hourly partition is stored
          under the key <code>EIOC/LI30/MP01/HEARTBEAT:2012_08_24_16.pb</code>.
          Data for the same PV in a daily partition is stored under the key
          <code>EIOC/LI30/MP01/HEARTBEAT:2012_08_24.pb</code> for the day
          <code>2012-08-24Txx:xx:xx.xxxZ</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ConvertPVNameToKey.html"
            >default</a
          >
          key mapping strategy, it is important (for performance reasons) that
          the PV names follow a good naming convention that distributes the
          chunks into many folders - see the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ConvertPVNameToKey.html"
            >Javadoc</a
          >
          for more details. If the
          <i>key/file structure reflecting the PV naming convention</i> feature
          is not important to you, you can choose to use an alternate key
          mapping strategy by implementing the
          <a
            href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/PVNameToKeyMapping.html"
            >PVNameToKeyMapping</a
          >
          interface and setting this
          <a

            >property</a
          >
          to name of the implementing class.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Persistence">
        <h3>Persistence</h3>
        By default, the configuration for each appliance is stored in a
        relational database (using connections obtained from JNDI) as key/value
        pairs. The install guide has instructions on how to set up a MySQL
        connection pool in tomcat. For smaller installs with minimal concurrent
        access, one can also configure Tomcat to use a
        <a href="sqlite.html">SQLite</a> backend.
        <br />
        Alternate mechanisms for persisting archiver configuration are possible;
        see the
        <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ConfigPersistence.html"
          >ConfigPersistence</a
        >
        interface. To save your configuration in a different location, create an
        implementation of this interface and use the

          >ARCHAPPL_PERSISTENCE_LAYER</a

        environment in your startup scripts.

      <section id="StoragePlugins">
        <h3>Storage Plugins</h3>
        The starting point for using an alternate storage technology is to

        Writing a new StoragePlugin does take some effort but with this
        separation, you should be able to support a wide variety of storage
        technologies. For more details, please see the Javadoc.

        The
        <a
          href="api/edu/stanford/slac/archiverappliance/PlainPB/PlainPBStoragePlugin.html"
          >PlainPBStoragePlugin</a
        >
        can be viewed as a chunking
        <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/StoragePlugin.html"
          >StoragePlugin</a
        >. It chunks data into
        <span title="Time instant t &harr; Chunk key">clean</span>, well-defined
        time-partitions (instead of individual samples) and various business
        processes in the archiver appliance understand these time-partitions and
        deal with them efficiently. Each chunk has a well defined
        <a href="key_mapping">key</a> and one can choose to store a chunk in any
        storage provider that provides block storage. The PlainPBStoragePlugin
        uses Java
        <a
          href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/package-summary.html"
          >NIO2</a
        >
        as the storage API. Java NIO2 has a
        <a
          href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/io/fsp/filesystemprovider.html"
          >documented mechanism</a
        >
        for developing custom file system providers. Using custom NIO2 file
        system providers, one can store the chunks generated by the
        PlainPBStoragePlugin using storage technologies like
        <ol>
          <li>Database BLOBS</li>
          <li>Any key/value store (for example, SciDB)</li>
          <li>Other technologies that may be more appropriate</li>
        </ol>
        To add custom NIO2 file system providers for use in the archiver
        appliance, please look at the JavaDoc for our version of Java's
        <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/utils/nio/ArchPaths.html"
          >Paths</a
        >.

      <section id="TypeSystems">
        <h3>Type systems</h3>
        The archiver appliance uses Google's
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers"
          >ProtocolBuffers</a
        >
        as the serialization scheme. There are plenty of other algorithms that
        offer the same functionality, of great interest is the serialization
        scheme used in the
        <a
          href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html"
          >EPICS V4 protocol</a
        >. Support for alternate serialization mechanisms is possible by adding
        support for
        <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/TypeSystem.html"
          >alternate type systems</a
        >. Please contact the collaboration if you'd want to consider using
        alternate serialization mechanisms.

      <section id="ConfigService">
        <h3>ConfigService</h3>
        All of the configuration in the archiver appliance is handled thru
        implementations of the
        <a href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ConfigService.html"
          >ConfigService</a
        >
        interface. Each webapp has one instance of this interface and this
        instance is dependency injected into the classes that need it. If all
        else fails, you can create your implementation of the ConfigService and
        register it in the servlet context
        <a
          href="api/org/epics/archiverappliance/config/ArchServletContextListener.html"
